Affirmative, but a call from headquarters has come through.
Right…well put it through.
Ah finally reached you. How has your mission gone so far?
Terribly. I haven’t found anyone and there is something else, here.

Orbital station, G-35t0
You're meant to be at “C-091 get there immediately. You're currently at a construction site.
Oh… damn. Okay leaving immediately? I suppose the monster noises I heard would have been the station being built.
